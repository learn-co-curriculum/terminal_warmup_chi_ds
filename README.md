# Terminal Warmup Exercise

Yesterday, we learned to create folders, files, and print their content to the terminal.  Today, we will start with some basic data exploration in the command line. Let's explore the data found at the following url.  Open up a terminal window, navigate to a directory where you want to store the data, and run the following command:


```
curl http://rcs.bu.edu/examples/python/data_analysis/flights.csv -o flights.csv
```


```python

```
